Awards can be configured through either environment variables or a
`settings.ini` file. An `example_settings.ini` file has been provided. You can
kickstart your configuration with::

    Configuration for tests should be specified in the `testenv.setenv` section
    of `tox.ini`.

The migrations can be applied by running::

    $ tox -e migrate

New migrations can be generated by running::

    $ tox -e makemigrations

=======
Testing
=======

While all tests will be as part of CI, they can also be run locally through
tox_.

----------
Unit tests
----------

The unit tests will be run whenever tox is envoked without specifying an
environment, but can be run directly with::

    $ tox -e unit

-----------
Type checks
-----------

The type checks are done using pyre_ and can be run with::

    $ tox -e types
